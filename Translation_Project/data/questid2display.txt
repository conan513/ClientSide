Echinacea is analyzing the pattern number to detect the magic wavelength strength. This could lead us to Rayan and maybe even Satan Morocc...#

7035#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go to the building with a mana detector attached to it at the south of this camp and ask about the trace results.#
#

7036#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

레오와 대화 중 카르듀이에 대한 석연치 않은 이야기를 듣게 되었다. 레오는 더 자세히 말할 생각이 없는 듯 하지만 묘하게 신경 쓰인다.#
#

7424#왕에 대한 소문 2#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
포메로부터 의외의 이야기를 들었다. 라피네들이 카르듀이를 은근히 꺼린다는 것이다. 일전에 들었던 레오의 태도와도 비슷한 이야기다.#
#

7425#왕에 대한 소문 3#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
라피네들을 통해 세네스의 폭정과 카르듀이를 연관짓는 이야기를 들었다. 심각하진 않지만 현재의 왕인 카르듀이를 모종의 이유로 우려하고 있음은 분명하다.#
#

7426#왕에 대한 소문 4#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
최근 라피네 종족 전체에 닥친 악재 속에서 카르듀이가 마요르 쥰이 된 모양이다. 카르듀이의 정책에 대놓고 반대는 하지 않지만 공감하지는 않는듯 하다.#
#

7427#이럴땐 정공법이다!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
라피네들이 카르듀이에게 느끼는 불안감과 우려의 진상에 대해 더이상 알아낼 수 없다. 일단 이 이야기는 본인에게 전해줘야 하지 않을까? 원인에 대한 이야기를 들을 수 있을지도..#

#

7437#쉬나임의 부탁#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
에이반트에 대한 정보는 고사하고 쉬나임에게서 이상한 의뢰나 받았다. 자신이 후원하는 마학자의 실험재료를 구해달라고 한다. 재료는 먼지 덩어리 10개, 낙엽 책갈피 10개#

군수참모와 대화#

7446#소득없는 대화#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
군수참모 쉬나임과 대화를 해 보았으나 딱히 소득이 없다. 그는 자기도 에이반트이 감언이설에 속은거 같다고 한다. 군수참모는 오히려 카르듀이가 오브의 보호 경계를 강화 한 것에 강한 불만을 나타내고 있다.#
카르듀이에게 보고#

7447#오브를 둘러싼 갈등#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
에이반트의 연구에 대한 것보다 카르듀이에 대한 불신감만 확인하고 말았다. 군수참모는 카르듀이의 판단이 흐리지 않았기를 바라며, 그 증인이 되라고 한다.#
카르듀이에게 보고#

7448#아무래도 수상해#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
카르듀이, 히시에와 상의 한 결과 유독 오브쪽으로 주의를 끌려는 군수참모가 역시 수상하다는 판단을 내린다. 오브의 연구를 의뢰한 것이 아니면서 카르듀이의 오브에 대한 정책에 반발하는 이유는 뭘까?#

일련의 사건의 책임을 지고 모든 배후로 지목된 그리고 현재는 행방이 불명한 군수참모 쉬나임을 찾기로 했다. 히시에의 정보에 의하면 비프로스트까지 잔존 마력이 희미하게 느껴졌다고 한다.#

#

8017#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto has asked you to help him inspect the machines in the factory one at a time to know which one needs to be fixed. Find the 2nd control panel and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8018#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the 2nd control panel and it is completely broken. Report this back to Zelmeto.#
#

8019#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect the automatic pressure governors and to report any problems no matter how small they may seem.#
#

8020#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the automatic pressure governors and after checking more carefully, you find that it's making strange grinding noises and a few of the surface screws are loose. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8021#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now Zelmeto asked you to inspect another control panel. It's similar to the first one but bigger. It's located in the middle of the factory. Find it and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8022#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The main control panel doesn't look like it has any problems. But after tapping on its surface, you hear a disheartening hollow sound. It looks like it's missing some parts... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8023#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect a mechanical hand that transports small objects. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8024#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The conveyor's movements look jittery and clumsy. The mechanical arm also doesn't look powerful enough to bear the loads that it's carrying... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8025#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now you must inspect a pipe located near the large cauldrons of molten metal and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8026#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The pipe you found is bloated and worn out from long durations of being overloaded with pressure. It's a wonder it hasn't exploded yet. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8027#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The final thing Zelmeto has asked you to inspect is a bigger and more powerful conveyor. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8028#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This last conveyor seems to have similar problems to its smaller version. Its movements are awkward, erratic and weak, and almost all of its screws are rusted. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8029#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto tells you that he needs to request an increase in the Factory Repair budget from the superintendant to make sure they have enough materials for the repairs. Find the superintendant.#
#

8030#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The superintendant refused to approve the increase in the Factory Repair budget. You'd better report the bad news to Zelmeto.#
#

8031#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto still wants to make the repairs so he has asked you to bring back ^FF000020 Flexible Tube^000000, ^FF000010 Rusty Screw^000000, and ^FF000010 Used Iron Plate^000000 so they can make the needed repairs.#
#

8032#Tarlock's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Tarlock says that he wouldn't mind telling you how the Airship works if you do him a favor of delivering a letter to his brother Ferlock.#
Deliver Tarlock's letter to his brother.#

8033#Ferlock's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ferlock has asked you retrieve his stolen things from the monsters that attack Tarlock's Airship.#
Bring 2 Will of the Darkness and 2 Prickly Fruit back to Ferlock.#

8034#Ferlock's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ferlock asked you to take his reply to his brother Tarlock for him.#
Deliver the letter from Ferlock to his brother, Tarlock.#

8035#How the Airship Works#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have delivered Ferlock's letter to Tarlock. Now may be a good time to ask him about how the Airship Works.#
Continue speaking to Tarlock.#

8036#Hallen's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hallen has asked you to deliver a letter to Kaci from someone named Mr. Mawong who is something like her mentor.#
Deliver the letter to Kaci.#

8037#The Dice Roller#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have delivered Hallen's letter to Kaci. You should probably find out what she knows...#
#

8038#The Dice Roller#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It turns out that Kaci is Hallen's cousin. After answering your questions she has gone back to running her games. Who else would know of their past?#
#

8039#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hallen tells you that his project is to learn more about how the Airships work. It could benefit you to ask someone who would be knowledgeable about Airships for yourself and report your findings to Hallen.#
#

8040#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Really...? Are you serious? An imitation of Ymir's Heart Piece. Now where have I heard about that before? Mm, let me think... #
Continue talking to Hallen.#

8041#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kaci told me about a drunkard that always mentions Ymir's Heart when he plays the Dice game for Apples!#
 #

8042#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You find out that the director at the Einbroch Laboratory has a piece of Ymir's Heart. It's worth investigating...#
 #

8043#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You better get out of here. The guards patrol this place regularly, so you're almost sure to get caught. Hmm, come and see me later at the Airship, alright? Now hurry!#
You must go and see Ferlock.#

8044#Euslan's Fiancee#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...Are you really willing to go out and look for Thierry for me? Oh, thank you so much! You don't know how much your kind offer means to me. Thierry went on a trip, traveling on one of the Airships, to find some medicine that the doctors say I need for my illness.#
 #

8045#Tips from Kaci#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ah, I know! I'll ask the Airship Captain to help you: he's got the list of passengers and their destinations.#
Check out the passengers list from the captain.#

8046#Ferlock's Passengers list#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
According to this, he last took an Airship to Hugel. That's all that this says.#
 #

8047#Euslan's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
If you get the chance, please visit my brother Eukran in Hugel, and ask him where my Thierry might be.#
 #

8048#Eukran's Testimony#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You see, Thierry passed by here about a month ago, and told me that he had to visit the Odin Shrine. I wasn't sure then, but now I think he's trying to help my sister.#
 #

8049#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't really go into the details, but I'm doing this work to find a cure for Euslan's disease. It's not curable by modern medicine...#
 #

8050#Danger coming on to Thierry#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Thierry seems to have caught on to what we're really up to. I think that's why he's slowing down on his research. We better get rid of him before it's too late.#
 #

8051#Euslan's Medicine#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It doesn't matter what happens to me, but I must save Euslan. I only need 5 Runes of the Darkness to finish that medicine. Please help me get them, adventurer...#
Gather 5 Runes of the Darkness#

8052#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please understand that I want to see her as soon as I can, but I have to wait until those Rekenber agents stop searching for me. Please give that medicine to Euslan as soon as you can: her life depends on it.#
Deliver the medicine to Euslan.#

8053#Find Postell#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Allen's son Postell and to tell him to bring his medicine! Head east, go outside of town, and you should be able to find Postell.#
Postell#

8054#Message from Postell#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Postell has asked you to do him a favor and make sure that his dad doesn't get himself into any more trouble.#
Go back to Allen#

8055#Nursing Allen#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wh-what if I have another ulcer attack before Postell can bring my meds?! I might not survive! A-adventurer, would you please stay by my side until my son arrives?#
Take care of Allen.#

8056#Little something in return#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
''Please take a look inside the medicine drawer, and help yourself to whatever you like'' ~Allen#
Look inside the medicine drawer.#

8057#Grumbling Manainne#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Speak to Manainne about the comforting tree.#
#

8058#Conversation with El Schatt#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
''This tree means so much to everyone in this town, and we all have special memories of this place. But that El Schatt fellow plans to chop it down for his shop...'' -Manainne#
#

8059#Conversation with Perfitz#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
El Schatt says that his father's been wanting to build a shop here for a long time. Talk to his father Perfitz and get his side of the story.#
#

8060#Stubborn El Schatt#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
''Although I'm pleased, I get this gut feeling that something's not right, like he's too excited about cutting that tree down. Maybe this old man is just too suspicious~'' -Perfitz#
#

8061#Stories of the past#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
El Schatt says that there was a time when he would have protected the tree with his life but that it should be buried in the past. You should find someone that might know about his past.#
#

8062#Kanainne#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
''Now El Schatt is just a heartless, money grubbing...! He's completely changed. My sister would be rolling in her grave, seeing him now...'' -Manainne#
#

8063#Kanainne's spirit#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
''I... I can borrow my sister's body? Yes, if she cooperates, maybe... Maybe it will work. I must... must do something before he... he... he hurts himself even more...#

8068#Cellette's Fish Cake Soup#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You're late! Don't you know this soup isn't good if it isn't steaming hot? But... I'll forgive you... On one condition. Bring me ^FF00001 Whip^000000 with which to spank you. You better hurry, or I won't let you off so easily.#
Bring 1 Whip to Neha.#

8069#Cellette's Fish Cake Soup#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
"Argh, but you're late! This is your fault, you know that, right? I can forgive you if you help me with my collection. Just bring me 1 Bookclip in Memory, alright?"#
Bring 1 Bookclip in Memory to Maewan#

8070#Cellette's Fish Cake Soup#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

Bring 1 Mushroom Spore to Layoma.#

8071#Cellette's Fish Cake Soup#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
"Hm, but as the first son of the Franchesfeschu family, I cannot eat this soup unless it is suitably prepared. Go! I command you to bring me the commoner's ^ff0000China^000000!"#
Bring Erjan 1 China.#

8072#Cellette's Fish Cake Soup#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
"Ooh, did I accidentally whip you twice? Heh heh... Well, I'm satisfied. I'll go ahead and tell Cellette that you did a good job... I hope you come deliver my soup again~"#
Return to Cellette.#

8073#Cellette's Fish Cake Soup#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
"Great, you really brought me a Bookclip in Memory! Yes, this'll make a fine addition to my collection~ Oh, and give me my soup. Thanks again for delivering~"#
Return to Cellette.#

8074#Cellette's Fish Cake Soup#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
"Alright, maybe I can count on you to work for my roommate Cellette a little while longer. Oh, and please tell her not to come home so late all the time, okay?"#
Return to Cellette.#

8075#Cellette's Fish Cake Soup#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
"You are dismissed. Please take your leave, and return to Cellette with my noble thanks."#
Return to Cellette.#

8076#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I know I'm acting like a complete idiot. But I'd give anything to see Calla... Just don't listen to anything I say. I'm just a poor fool in love with the wrong person. That has to be it....#
 #

8077#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Well, maybe I can't see him, but would you give my violin to Klitzer for me? I used to play this for him all the time...#
Take Calla's Violin to Klitzer.#

8078#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
That's my daughter's Violin. I gave that to her for her sweet sixteen... You've crossed the line, punk! Guards! Get over here!#
Calla's Violin is taken away.#

8079#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All you need to do is just give her ^FF00001 Flower^000000. I don't have the zeny and I don't think I'm welcome at Kapellthaine Manor.#
Bring 1 Flower to Calla.#

8080#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Oh, if you pass by Einbroch, would you thank Klitzer for the flower for me please? A-and... And... Please tell him that I really miss him a lot.#
Deliver Calla's message to Klitzer.#

8081#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I feel so much better now. Oh! When you have the time, why don't you talk to my mother? She always likes meeting my friends.#
Meet Klitzer's mother.#

8082#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't bear to see the petty hatred between our two towns stop my son from seeing the woman he loves... Find someone who may know of the history of Einbroch and Einbech.#
 #

8083#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Why don't you bring me ^990000Coals^000000? It's not impossible for someone like yourself, but this kind of task will require some effort on your part.#
Bring Coals to Satra.#

8084#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Well, I shall try to find some use for these. I'm afraid the gift I've asked from you isn't very practical. How is Coal usually used? Ah, I have a novel idea! It seems that bringing Coals will get Satra to talk.#
Bring more Coals to Satra.#

8085#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Anyway, when you next meet Klitzer, please tell him to pay me a visit soon. Oh, and remind him to dress appropriately for this special occasion. Ho ho ho ho ho~!#
Deliver the message to Klitzer.#

8086#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Eh...?  What did you just say? Did you just say that Calla's mother wants me to have tea with her? Holy moley...!!#
 #

8087#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Thank you for helping my son Klitzer. Sadly, the little fool doesn't have any clue when it comes to certain things like choosing clothing. A man should wear nice clothes, like a Formal Suit or a Tuxedo, for important meetings and special occasions. #
Get Klitzer a nice outfit.#

8088#Klitzer and Calla#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've really opened my eyes. From now on, I'll do my best to earn the approval of Calla's parents and become worthy of Calla's love.#
 #

8089#Stolen Gemstone#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't have any proof, but I suspect it was stolen by Phobe, a servant that disappeared about the same time the gem disappeared. You might want to question the other servants of his whereabouts.#
Get some information on Phobe's whereabouts.#

8090#Mr. Manson#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Truth be told, I don't know much since I just started working here. Why don't you ask the senior employees? You could ask Mr. Manson inside the mansion.#
Find Mr. Manson.#

8091#Jenny the gardener#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ah, our gardener Jenny was the one that introduced me to him. She's worked for Sir Zhed for a long time, and she loves kids. You know, if you want to know more about that kid, you should talk to Jenny.#
Find Jenny.#

8092#Searching the Market#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Alright, I guess I can go to the market and ask around.#
Go to the Market.#

8093#Mysterious Message#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
So yeah, last night, some guy asked me to tell anyone looking for this guy named Phobe to give you a message. Basically, he wants you to come to the 'ice cave.' Let's see, his name was... Nogan? Rogan? Something like that.#
Go to the Ice Cave.#

8094#Double Crossed?e#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Vincent's instructions were to kill anyone that asked about Rogan, some name he made up. It looks like he set us up, dude. Sorry, if I had known, I wouldn't have done it.#
Go back to Vincent.#

8095#Find Phobe#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You won't get in trouble if I can find the jewel and Phobe before Sir Zhed returns, so I'll try to find them for you as soon as I can. Phobe is just a kid, so he's probably hiding somewhere in town...#
Try finding Phobe.#

8096#Stolen Gemstone Found#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Just so you know, I don't plan on going back home! Well, just not this second anyway. But let my mom know that I'm fine and not to worry.#
Go back to Vincent.#

8097#Informing Jenny#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
While I return this jewel, would you please tell my wife Jenny that our boy is okay? She's been very worried about him, so...#
Jenny.#

8098#Keeping the Secret#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Thank you for all of your help, adventurer~#
Go back to Vincent.#

8099#Vincent's Recommendation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This note is a letter of recommendation hat I have written for you. Please deliver it to Sir Zhed as soon as possible. Good bye, and thank you for everything.#
Go see Sir Zhed.#

8100#Recommendation from High Priest Zhed#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
While I finish writing this recommendation, let me tell you how to get to the pope's office where you must go once you gather 40 Glacial Hearts.#
Gather 40 Glacial Hearts and go see the Pope.#

8101#Recommendation from High Priest Zhed#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I really want to thank you for coming to speak to me. I had a great time learning. Now I have to go officiate services, so... This is goodbye for now...#
Go back to Zhed.#

8102#Recommendation from High Priest Zhed#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'm sorry, but we're not quite finished with our discussion. Why don't you wait and relax in the next room over there in the meantime?#
 #

8103#Recommendation from High Priest Zhed#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I want to give you a bit of advice. Don't get too close to High Priest Zhed. If you do, you might end up getting yourself in trouble...#
Go back to Zhed.#

8104#Recommendation from High Priest Zhed#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ah, but before you go, let me warn you not to ^FF0000go near the Holy Ground^000000. I repeat, stay away from the Holy Ground.#
 #

8105#Recommendation from High Priest Zhed#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I warned Bekento that he might cause trouble for you, but it seems that you've caused trouble for him. Understand this: most intruders are severely punished, but because of my friendship with Bekento, I'm letting you off easy. Remember that...#
Go back to Zhed.#

8106#Mr. Shendar's daughter#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

How did the nurse get through with the entrance bolted up?#
Return to Las.#

11304#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wouldn't the grandmother who pasted the agimat outside of the hospital know about this agimat?#
Talk to the grandmother.#

11305#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Asked Shaman at the north of the village to create this.#
Visit Shaman at the north of the village.#

11306#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I feel something very ominous from you.#
Received an agimat. Return to Las.#

11307#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Let's paste that agimat onto the agimat we saw at the 2F entrance. It might help block the ominous energy from that one.#
Past the agimat onto the 2F entrance agimat.#

11308#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
As soon as you paste the agimat on top of the other one, the ominous energy feels faded away just like Las said.#
Feel like Las was playing you. Talk to the nurse in front of the hospital.#

Ask Librarian Jekan if he has found the 1st squad's final mission's paper work. He has bad eyesight and is in need of a Magnifier and a Lantern.#
#

60724#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Librarian Jekan looks to be busy, perhaps I should just 'read some documents' for awhile and then check on the shelves for until he figures out where I should check on the shelves for 'The 3rd Platoon Records'.#
#

60725#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jekan will need a few items to make a copy of the records. 2 Slick Paper and 1 Oil Paper from Amatsu, 3 Feather of Birds from Morroc, and 20 Blue Gems from Geffen.#
Bring these items to Jekan to make him finish the copy faster.#

60726#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Your copy of the records has a weird search magic on it. To find specific info, you need to first check for broad topic then get more specific: crusader 3rd_company 3rd_platoon 1st_squad.#
Look up the individual members names to find out where they are nowadays.#

60727#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Zan Huadoku inside the Geffen Blacksmith guild. Observe politeness when asking him how he is doing before jumping in to ask about their top secret final mission. Yeah, that's the ticket!#
#

60728#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zan Huadoku has told you all that you think is possible. You should head to Morroc to find 'Cuaque Donon' who was last seen at the Inn. You have a feeling that you may need to be stubborn in Morroc.#
#

60729#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque Donon is in a Rogue Guild hideout probably at 'Fortress Saint Darmain (South)' [use map ctrl + ~] The password to enter should be 'Aragham never hoarded upgrade items'.#
Cuaque is suffering from extreme PTSD and 'freaks out' so pretending he is a young child would help, maybe even a dolly hahaha.#

60730#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque said the squad found the 'Megingjard' and an argument broke out... You need to know more about that argument, perhaps Jack.O in Alberta on the docks can help.#
He is still an active crusader, so I think talking to him will be much more straight forward.#

60731#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jack.O found some relief from 'Green Herb's.  Perhaps I should pass that advice onto the other Crusaders I meet.  Emma Searth is in Aldebaran, a quick boat to Izlude and a Kafra warp to Aldebaran will have me there in a jiffy!#
Maybe I should also contemplate a memory aid for these crusaders, something to help them remember their place like a 'Bookclip' from a 'Rideword'#

60732#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I think I need to hurry to see 'The Nineball' he works as a bouncer in the Jawaii inn. I heard there is an ex-barkeep of Jawaii working in the Central Prontera Pub maybe he knows a way to get to Jawaii without tying the knot!#
Someone named Nineball and who is a bouncer probably is pretty closed mouth kinda guy, I should keep talking until he at least reacts to my questions...#

60733#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Exit Jawaii with a Butterflywing or drink yourself back to Rune-Midgarts. Get to Comodo to see 'Royal Myst' at the south casino. Morroc to Comodo is usually the easiest way to warp to Comodo.#
A 'couple' of shots of 'Alcohol' can loosen Royal Myst's tongue...#

60734#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've spoken to all the crusaders that are still alive, apparently something happened, blame was passed and Crusader Egnigem died in the process. You should return to Prontera Castle and inform him of your findings.#
A kafra hop from Comodo to Morroc to Prontera is quick unless you're saved in Prontera.#

60735#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You should talk to the last member of the 1st squad, the late Egnigem. A Kafra hop from Prontera to Morroc to Comodo then to Umbala and then a journey north to the Tree of Life to Nifflheim can get you to him.#
Listen to Egnigem and see what you can do to fix this.#

60736#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
By Odin's mercy this is terrible, you never believed that a holy Crusader would do such an evil act to claim the power of Megingjard. Be brave and return to the Crusader Headquarters and tell Max Von Shedough what you know.#
#

60737#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Max Von Shedough has accepted my report, and is deeply troubled by its contents, but part of me truly believes that despite good intentions the political reality may intervene to keep justice from being had.#
I must tell Egnigem at least of the outcome, he deserves at least to know what he died for..#

60738#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Egnigem has blessed you with all his remaining strength. You have a feeling that there is one special someone that he would want to know his fate, You must tell Emma Searth about his fate.#
#

60739#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Emma can't Remember, but she can feel the loss. Your faith in Justice is weak now... You must tell Max Von Shedough he is the Judge and he should share this burden of guilt.#
