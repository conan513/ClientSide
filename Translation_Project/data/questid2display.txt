The conversation with Echinacea was a rather one-sided talk. You have been assigned to be Mr. Kidd's assistant so you better go speak to him.#
Mr. Kidd#

7013#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...You have expressed that you're not comfortable with doing chores and Mr. Kidd tells you to be clear with Echinacea that you don't want the task.#
Echinacea#

7014#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...Well, it was still impossible to win Echinacea over. You should just go back and help Mr. Kidd no matter what.#
Mr. Kidd#

7015#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mr. Kidd's request was simpler than you thought. At Southwest Morroc, you must meet Rin at the underground tavern.#
Rin#

7016#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You must investigate the region where Rin was ambushed. The area is somewhere west of Abyss Lake and south of the second hill from the top of the mountain...#

7021#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have found a Sealed Magic Scroll from one of the of a Dandelion Gang's bodies. It must be something important so you should bring it to Mr. Kidd.#
Report to Mr. Kidd#

7022#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You need to investigate the magic spell scroll. Echinacea knows which scholar to consult about it.#
Echinacea#

7023#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Echinacea has introduced a scholar named 'Defaria' but where is he? Is he the one baking sweet potatoes?#
Speak to Defaria#

7024#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The old scholar Defaria requested for some materials to unseal the scroll.#
30 of each Holy Water, Rune of Darkness, Bloody Rune#

7025#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You need to get all the required materials. Defaria said, 'I’ll be waiting for your return.'#

7026#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scroll is unsealed. Such scrolls are generally used by ^4d4dfforganizations to gather their members^000000. He says you should use it now but it's a question whether you should talk to Mr. Kidd first.#
#

7027#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You heard some suspicious story while investigating the building where you arrived by using the scroll. You heard that the Dandelions are fighting each other..#
Report to Mr. Kidd#

7028#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You told Mr. Kidd what you've heard from the basement in the empty house near the national border. There will be a serious internal dispute and it'd be the perfect time to raid them.#

7034#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Echinacea is analyzing the pattern number to detect the magic wavelength strength. This could lead us to Rayan and maybe even Satan Morocc...#
#

7035#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go to the building with a mana detector attached to it at the south of this camp and ask about the trace results.#
#

7036#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The trace failed but the Manager says that since the stone is still intact that Rayan must still be alive somewhere. Report to Echinacea and ask her if she has any ideas on tracing Rayan Moore.#
Report to Echinacea#

7037#Case closed?#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The case is closed now, but what is this thing that still lingers in your head? You should ask somebody about the Dandelion request because Echinacea isn't being too helpful.#

Ah, I know! I'll ask the Airship Captain to help you: he's got the list of passengers and their destinations.#
Check out the passengers list from the captain.#

If you get the chance, please visit my brother Eukran in Hugel, and ask him where my Thierry might be.#
 #

8048#Eukran's Testimony#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You see, Thierry passed by here about a month ago, and told me that he had to visit the Odin Shrine. I wasn't sure then, but now I think he's trying to help my sister.#
 #

8049#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't really go into the details, but I'm doing this work to find a cure for Euslan's disease. It's not curable by modern medicine...#
 #

8050#Danger coming on to Thierry#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Thierry seems to have caught on to what we're really up to. I think that's why he's slowing down on his research. We better get rid of him before it's too late.#
 #

8051#Euslan's Medicine#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It doesn't matter what happens to me, but I must save Euslan. I only need 5 Runes of the Darkness to finish that medicine. Please help me get them, adventurer...#
Gather 5 Runes of the Darkness#

8052#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please understand that I want to see her as soon as I can, but I have to wait until those Rekenber agents stop searching for me. Please give that medicine to Euslan as soon as you can: her life depends on it.#
Deliver the medicine to Euslan.#

This tree means so much to everyone in this town, and we all have special memories of this place. But that El Schatt fellow plans to chop it down for his shop...#
 #

Look, memories are nice and all, but I don't dwell on the past. Hey, I've got some great memories of this place too, but you know what? I've decided to let go of them before they get too painful. That's life. My father's been wanting to build a shop here for so long, and now, I think it's about time.#

I'm pleased that my son has finally set his mind on the family business. It's funny... He used to deperately fight me when it came to building shops where that tree has planted. I get this gut feeling that something's not right, like he's too excited about cutting that tree down. Maybe this old man is just too suspcious~#

Find Mikhail. He wouldn't have left the village.#

11059#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
kk.. He's a fool and has no friend. But among our villagers, ^3131FFa lady of Inn 'Sticky Herb Tree'^000000 really liked him.#
It's the only clue. Go to the Inn Sticky Herb Tree.#

If you promise me to stay overnight, I'll tell you about what you want to know. Deal?#
Stay overnight and get the info.#

11061#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
He looked pale and asked me a high-strength adhesive. He might have broken something important. I told him to go look in the bar where bunch of guys usually are at.#
Looks like Mikhail went to the bar. Go to the bar and find him.#

11062#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't know much about adhesives so I introduced Mikhail an expert, that guy over there named Victor.#
Lookslike Mikhail is no longer at the bar.  Ask Victor about Mikhail's whereabouts.#

11063#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Here you are. This is what you ordered. Have fun!#
Approach Victor while drinking.#

11064#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
To get the stuff for a high-strength adhesive, we should go to  an isloated swamp. I don't believe that the little and timid boy like Mikhail goes there.#
Where would he be? Maybe you should go to the swamp just in case.#

11065#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You feel sticky just when you see a swamp.  Gas bubbles are rising. The atmosphere  here is pretty fearful.#
I don't see any traces. Firest, I'm going back to Mikhail's.#

11066#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You searched the house again and found Mikhail hiding inside the fire pot. Let's get the adhesive to help Mikhail fix Matroshuca.#
Go back to Victor to ask what materials are needed to make the adhesive exactly.#  

11067#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
There's a large island near Moscovia. If you go deep into its forest, you can find a swamp where sticky weeds are growing. You should bring^3131FF'10 sticky herbs'^000000 and ^3131FF 1 medicine bowl^000000 to me.#
Bring 10 sticky hervs and 1 medicine bowl to Victor!#

11068#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ok, done! I don't want you to bother me any longer! Please go with that stuff!#
You've got the adhesive.  Go back to Mikhail.#

Now I'm going to give this Matroshuca back to Mom.#
Mikhail finally came out of the fire pot. Return to Gallina.#

Why do you want to learn about it? Even if I wanted to teach, I'm too old to remember everything. Go find my last disciple, ^0000FF'Song Zhi Du'^000000, as he may tell you something useful.#
Find Song Zhi Du working at the doctor's office and ask about the use of poison.#

11071#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go do whatever you were going to do. I'm just disappointed...#
Song Zhi Du seems to be mad now. Can make him feel better by bringing something to him.#

Return to Song Zhi Du with materials he asked for.#

11073#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All that's left is to create this poison, and then to get the lord of Louyang to drink it...#
Talk to him again and listen to the story, then do the favor of Song Zhi Du.#

11074#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now that the fee is paid, please bring this to Song Zhi Du.#
You've obtained the material. Go back to Song Zhi Du.#

11075#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
No!! I failed again! And I spent a long time preparing all of those materials...#
More materials are needed.#

11076#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please sneak into the Castle of the Dragon. I want you to put this poison some place where Lord Bai Long might stay. Anyway, I'm sure my master will be happy to know that I finally created the ^0000FFpoison he wished to create^000000!#
What should I do?#

11077#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found a drink bottle that's possibly owned by Bai Long, lord of Louyang. You put the deadly poison into the bottle.#
You've done what Song Zhi Du asked for. Let's go back.#

11078#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You tell Nagash Arses how Song Zhi Du created this Deadly Poison Bottle and his plan to get his revenge on the lord of Louyang.#
Looks like he needs some time alone.#

11079#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I beg of you. Please do not let him bring any harm to the lord. I am pretty sure he's been asking you, as well as others, for aid... Please interrupt him from carrying out his plan.#
Get rid of the drink bottle of Bai Long.#

11080#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You take the drink bottle and replace it with a bottle filled with Sticky Mucus. Hopefully Bai Long won't notice!#
Replacement Successful! Go back to Nagash Arses.#

내 소중한 친구가 좋아하던 장소 거든. 지칠 때면 항상 이 시계탑을 보며 쉬곤 했지.  친구와 고된 여행을 마치고 프론테라 남문을 들어설 때의 감동은 아직도 잊혀지지 않아.#
프론테라로 돌아가자. 카리안은 프론테라 남문으로 들어설때의 추억이 있는 것 같다.#

죤을 만났다.#

그런데 바쁘지 않으면 내 등 좀 긁어주지 않겠어? 벌레라도 물린 건지 요즘 들어 근질근질하거든. 내 등을 물어뜯을 만큼 굉장한 벌레녀석이 있는진 모르겠지만 말야.#
테일러를 만났다.#

11162#로즈의 이야기#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
내가 너무 멋있어서 곤란한 것 빼고는 아무 문제 없다고 전해줘. 난 완벽하니까 말야.#
로즈를 만났다.#

11163#베인의 이야기#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
전 별일 없이 잘 지내고 있다고 전해주시면 됩니다. 참 쉽죠?#
베인을 만났다.#

11164#래쉬의 이야기#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
뭐 안부라면 내 입으로 말할 것도 없이 이 팔뚝을 보면 '건강함'이라고 써있는 것 같지 않나? 자네가 본 그대로를 여과 없이 전해주면 된다네! 음핫핫핫핫핫!#
래쉬를 만났다.#

11165#브라이언에게 전달#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
프레드에게 그렇게 잔소릴 해댔는데 남의 말을 할 때가 아니었습니다. 하하. 프레드에게도 몸이 회복되면 곧 마을로 돌아가겠다고 전해주십시오.#
브라이언에게 전달 완료.#

11166#죤에게 전달#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

11171#프레드의 부탁#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
여기 앉아서 이거라도 먹으면서 쉬어요.#
다시 이야기를 나누어 보자.#

11172#프레드의 부탁#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
며칠 전 브라디움을 보충하러 온 친구들이 다시 동굴로 돌아가는 걸 보았으니 모두 그곳에 있겠죠. 부디 건강하게 잘 있어야 할 텐데. 내 친구들이 무사한지 보러 가주지 않겠어요?#
프레드의 친구 브라이언, 죤, 테일러, 로즈, 베인, 래쉬를 만나고 돌아오자.#

11173#프레드의 부탁#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
계속 이런 부탁해서 미안하지만 내 친구들에게 브라디움을 좀 전해주지 않겠어요? 마을 북서쪽 건물에 있는 보위씨에게 부탁하면 정제된 브라디움을 나눠 주실 거예요. 꼭 부탁 드려요.#
보위를 만나 정제된 브라디움을 받자.#

11174#물량 부족#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
커다란 브라디움광석은 정제하는데 많은 시간이 걸리지만 조그만 브라디움 조각들이라면 금방 사용할 수 있을 겁니다. 조그만 브라디움 조각 정도는 주변에 돌아다니는 몬스터만 잡아도 쉽게 구할 수 있습니다. 한 30개쯤이면 6명에게 나눠줄 만큼의 분량은 만들 수 있겠죠.#
브라디움의 물량이 부족해 여분이 없다고 한다. 조그만 브라디움을 30개 구해서 돌아오자.#

11175#물량 부족#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
지금처럼 소량을 정제 할 때는 기계를 사용하는 것 보다 수작업을 하는 쪽이 더 빠르기 때문에 1시간정도면 완성 할 수 있답니다. 그럼 제가 작업을 하는 동안 쉬고 계세요.#
작업을 하는데 2시간 정도 걸릴 것 같다.#

11176#친구들을 위해#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
완성했습니다! 수작업은 오랜만이라 조금 긴장하긴 했지만 잘 된 것 같아요. 어서 그들에게 나눠 주세요.#
정제된 브라디움을 친구들에게 나눠주고 프레드에게 돌아가 소식을 전하자.#

수풀에서 본 라피네에 대해 설명하고 찾아서 주머니를 돌려주자.#

11188#작은 주머니#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
말씀 드리는 대신 이 이야기에 대해서는 누구에게도 말씀하시면 안돼용! 그 약속을 지키실 수 있다면 제게 다시 말을 걸어 주세용.#
