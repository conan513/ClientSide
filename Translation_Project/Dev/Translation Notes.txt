ANY SKILL mentioned in the item descriptions use "KRO NAMES".
This is specially important in Intimidate (Snatch in IRO)
and Berserker (Frenzy in IRO) cases, to avoid confusions.

<<== Other Notes ==>>

--- Bard's Frost Joke:
There are 2 versions of Frost Joke.
If you don't want the standard one, simply revome the current "ba_frostjoke.txt"
and rename "[alternative]ba_frostjoke.txt" to "ba_frostjoke.txt". Done.

--- Monster Talking:
If you want some monsters to talk when fighting players rename "[custom]monstertalktable.xml"
to "monstertalktable.xml". Do note, only the <attack> tags work and there's nothing you can do
about it, because this feature is broken even in Gravity's AEGIS servers with no further development.

--- Skill Files:
Currently there are 3 options to choose. The default files are based on kRO skill names, with iRO name
at the bottom of description to avoid confusions. The "-iRO" files follow iRO skill names, with kRO name
at the bottom of description too. The "-hybrid" files are a mix of the kRO and iRO skill names, based on
a subjective selection of "best" names. You can check the respective skillnametables and choose the pair
you like the most. You only have to rename them to "skillnametable.txt" and "skilldesctable.txt".
